# FIT2101 Project

## Link to Website
https://slayfusion.onrender.com

## Link to Github Repository (needed for hosting)
https://github.com/Jasmine-PI/slayfusion-0.2


Note:

We're using a free instance to host the website on Render.
Free instance types will spin down with inactivity. 
To prevent this behaviour we would need to upgrade to a paid instance type.

Render could not connect to Monash Gitlab, we used a Github repository for hosting only.
